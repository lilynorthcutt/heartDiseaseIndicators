Heart Disease Indicators by Sex
================
2024-07-18

### Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, yet significant
gender disparities exist in its study and treatment. Historically,
research has predominantly focused on male patients, resulting in
diagnostic and treatment protocols that do not fully address the unique
ways in which heart disease manifests in women. This oversight has led
to a critical gap in our understanding and care of heart disease in
women.

The original data can me found
[here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). I have
already saved it as a csv file and will be accessing this file. Mutliple
researchers have explored this data and gotten good predictions on the
data!

**The goal of this project is not to maximize prediction accuracy, but
to explore how sex plays a role in heart disease indicators.** By doing
so, we aim to provide medical professionals with deeper insights into
the early indicators of heart disease and ensure that sex-specific
factors are considered for improved diagnosis and treatment.

To get started lets read in the data and take a look at the first 5
rows.

``` r
packages <- c("tidyr", "readxl", "dplyr", "magrittr", "purrr", 
              "ggplot2", "stringr", "snakecase", "knitr") 
invisible(lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE ))
```

``` r
df_raw <- read.csv("data/heart_disease.csv")
kable(df_raw[1:5,], caption = "Raw Data")
```

|----:|----:|----:|---------:|-----:|----:|--------:|--------:|------:|--------:|------:|----:|-----:|----:|

Raw Data

``` r
na_cols <- names(which(colSums(is.na(df_raw)) > 0))
print(na_cols)
```

    ## [1] "ca"   "thal"

The data consists of 14 columns, including `num` which is our heart
disease number. Two of these columns have `NA` values: `ca` and `thal`.
Lets clean up the data and start exploring what we have.

### Data Cleaning and Initial Observations

First, letâ€™s label the data in an easier way to understand for `num`
(heart disease), and `sex`.

``` r
# Add yes/no heart disease column
# Label sex as male/female for convenience
df <- df_raw %>% 
  mutate( heart_disease = case_when(
    num == 0 ~"Present", T ~"None"),
    sex = case_when(sex==1 ~"male", T ~"female"))

# View data with NA values
kable(df %>% filter(if_any(everything(), is.na)))
```

| age | sex    |  cp | trestbps | chol | fbs | restecg | thalach | exang | oldpeak | slope |  ca | thal | num | heart_disease |
|----:|:-------|----:|---------:|-----:|----:|--------:|--------:|------:|--------:|------:|----:|-----:|----:|:--------------|
|  53 | female |   3 |      128 |  216 |   0 |       2 |     115 |     0 |     0.0 |     1 |   0 |   NA |   0 | Present       |
|  52 | male   |   3 |      138 |  223 |   0 |       0 |     169 |     0 |     0.0 |     1 |  NA |    3 |   0 | Present       |
|  43 | male   |   4 |      132 |  247 |   1 |       2 |     143 |     1 |     0.1 |     2 |  NA |    7 |   1 | None          |
|  52 | male   |   4 |      128 |  204 |   1 |       0 |     156 |     1 |     1.0 |     2 |   0 |   NA |   2 | None          |
|  58 | male   |   2 |      125 |  220 |   0 |       0 |     144 |     0 |     0.4 |     2 |  NA |    7 |   0 | Present       |
|  38 | male   |   3 |      138 |  175 |   0 |       0 |     173 |     0 |     0.0 |     1 |  NA |    3 |   0 | Present       |

``` r
# Remove NAs
df %<>% drop_na()

# Plot heart disease vs. no disease 
ggplot(df, aes(x = heart_disease, fill = sex))+
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge())+
  ggtitle("Count of Detected Heart Disease for Women and Men")+xlab("Heart Disease")
```

``` r
# Heart Disease numbers by sex
men <- paste0("Men with HD:  ", df %>% filter(sex == 'male', heart_disease == 'Present') %>% nrow())

stats_to_print <- paste(men, women, sep = "\n")

cat(stats_to_print[1])

    ## Men with HD:  89

``` r
normalize <- function(x) {
  return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}

# Plot avg across all features for men and women
df %>% select(-num) %>% mutate_at(vars(-sex, -heart_disease), normalize)%>% 
  group_by(sex, heart_disease) %>%  summarise_all(mean) %>%  ungroup() %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols= !c("sex", "heart_disease"), names_to = 'feature', values_to = 'mean') %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = feature, y = mean, color = sex))+coord_flip()+facet_wrap(.~heart_disease)+ xlab("")+ylab("Normalized Mean")
```

![](writeup_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- --> During the
data cleaning process, six data points were removed due to missing
information. While imputation methods could be considered to address
this issue, for the purpose of this project, I have chosen to omit this
step. The primary goal here is to understand the impact of sex on
predicting heart disease, rather than achieving the highest possible
prediction accuracy.

An initial review of the dataset reveals a significant gender imbalance,
with more men represented in the study than women. This is true for both
individuals diagnosed with heart disease and those without. This
disparity is noteworthy and we should keep it in mind as we explore
further as it could potentially lead to a biased understanding of heart
disease indicators and outcomes.

The graph of feature means illustrates differences between feature
expression for those with and without heart disease. Additionally,
certain features, such as `thal`, `oldpeak`, and `exang`, display
distinct variations between men and women. This suggests that the same
approach to finding heart disease indicators may not be equally
effective for both men and women.
